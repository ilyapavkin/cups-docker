Place any patches that a driver or other project needs in a subfolder under this one and they will be made available in /home/patches.
Preferable format for the patches is to use quilt(1). 

Examples of patches to use are stable has some airprint compatibility patches for cups and sometimes when betas break I will add appropriate patches
to allow them to build and run.
